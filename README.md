# oim API

This repository contains multiple components including an example implementation of the oim API as a python webapp.

OIM stands for oneIT marketplace, where we use oneIT as "sum of IT departments across the Baloise Group" and marketplace for the idea of consuming and providing services in a automated, self-service manner.

It is work in progress and at this time not a full implementation.

## Components
* **apiserver** - Python webapp based on [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org), focusing on the [API-first](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#api-first) and [12-factor app](https://12factor.net) principles.
